# Legacy Bash Script

Originally this project worked via an implementation in bash.

This was raised as an issue in [Full re-write in Go](https://github.com/Link-/gh-token/issues/20) due to limitations of bash with different operating systems.

The original script can be found [here](https://github.com/Link-/gh-token/blob/db8e0eb480530fb84d9047f2e58bd4158371d1ff/gh-token) within Git history.
